# Starpath
A tiny raycasting demo for MSX Turbo R using R800 (based on Starpath by HellMood/DSR)

Code can be assembled with sjasmplus.

You can run the demo by typing the following in MSX-BASIC:
BLOAD "STARPATH.BIN",R

Use cursor keys up/down to move the camera up/down.

Use cursor keys left/right to move backwards/forwards.

The framerate is pretty low so you'll have to keep the cursor keys pressed for a while.
